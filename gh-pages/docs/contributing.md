### Developing

If you are interested in being a contributor and want to get involved in developing this project , we would love to hear from you!

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub

2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine

3.  Run **pre-commit** hooks (see note 2 below)

4.  **Commit** changes to your own branch

5.  **Push** your work back up to your fork

6.  Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes


**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest changes from "upstream" before making a pull request!

**NOTE 2:** Install local pre-commit hooks on MacOS by running 'brew install pre-commit' and 'pre-commit install' from project's root. Git will automatically run the project's pre-commit hooks on each 'git commit'. It might require additional tools to be installed such as 'tfsec' and 'tflint'.
